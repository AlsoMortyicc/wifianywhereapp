# What the HELL is it?

A terrible attempt at bringing back a dead meme/app.

## How to use it?

You install an IPA onto your device with whatever you use, (TrollStore, Sideloadly, AltStore, etc.)
then you open the app which opens a settings page to enable or disable WifiAnywhere (so real1!1!)

### Why did i make it?

Purely for fun and also as an experiment because why not, nothing better to do at 2 in the morning.

### Is it safe?

Yes. It's just a joke app, literally nothing else on it but a fake settings page that does literally nothing, and adding anything else to this is a waste of time.
